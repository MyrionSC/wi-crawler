<p>I would appreciate third party input on the matter. A disagreement arose about a citation currently present in the <a href="/wiki/Ernst_Lindemann" title="Ernst Lindemann">Ernst Lindemann</a> article; here's the <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ernst_Lindemann&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=770563659&amp;oldid=770563477">diff</a>.</p>

<p>The citations supports the subject's numerical position among all the other recipients, namely that he was 94th:</p>
<p>"Lindemann was the 94th recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross in the <i>Kriegsmarine</i>.Range 1974, p. 116."</p>
<p>I consider the material to be trivial, while the source being used is highly questionable and unsuitable for a Featured Article, which is supposed to represent Wikipedia's very best work. However, I'm unable to convince the other editor. The related discussion can be found here:</p>

<dd>This individual has tried to label all books published by this house as Neo-Nazi, without offering a shred of evidence the authors are engaged in this kind thing. This latest round is symptomatic of his behaviour. His attacks on the German-related articles, specifically related to World War II, looks like a crusade. I am pleased that a score of other editors have helped rebuff his attempts to project his own views on to these articles. The fact that he will dispute such a small (but not trivial) detail is typical of his unhelpful and destructive "contributions". <a href="/wiki/User:Dapi89" title="User:Dapi89">Dapi89</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Dapi89" title="User talk:Dapi89">talk</a>) 19:50, 31 March 2017 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As it happens, some articles on German WWII personnel contain indiscriminate amounts of information; ps see this recent discussion: <a href="/wiki/Talk:Hans-Ulrich_Rudel#Intricate_details" title="Talk:Hans-Ulrich Rudel">Talk:Hans-Ulrich Rudel#Intricate details</a>, where sections of the article are described by another editor as <span class="inline-quote-talk" style="font-family: Georgia, 'DejaVu Serif', serif; color: #008560;">meticulous investigations of insignificant details</span>.</dd>

<dd>In the case of the Lindemann article, such intricate detail is cited to a highly problematic source. I consider this information to be superfluous (along with editor <a href="/wiki/User:Ian_Rose" title="User:Ian Rose">Ian Rose</a> who has commented on Talk), and I'm seeking third party input on the matter. <a href="/wiki/User:K.e.coffman" title="User:K.e.coffman">K.e.coffman</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:K.e.coffman" title="User talk:K.e.coffman">talk</a>) 02:03, 1 April 2017 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see a couple of questions here, one is sourcing, and one is inclusion. A quick glance seems to indicate that the source is a published book, presumably not a self-published book, and probably meets wp:rs criteria. More to the point is whether the statement of receipt the award is wp:sourcable. It looks like a pretty straightforward statement and I don't see it's veracity being contested.</p>
<p>The next question is whether to include it in the article. One might interpret some guidance on this from WP: NPOV but I'm thinking not. So then it comes down to editorial discretion. In that area it is a matter of opinion, and mine is that a sentence on receipt of an award like that is appropriate for an article on that person. <b><font color="#0000CC"><i>North8000</i></font></b> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:North8000#top" title="User talk:North8000">talk</a>) 02:36, 1 April 2017 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Clarification</b> -- the matter of the award presentation is cited to other sources. Range is used to cite that the subject was <i>94th</i> such recipient in this branch of service. This is is not remarkable as he was neither the 1st nor 4th, for example. I clarified above. <a href="/wiki/User:K.e.coffman" title="User:K.e.coffman">K.e.coffman</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:K.e.coffman" title="User talk:K.e.coffman">talk</a>) 03:01, 1 April 2017 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This is another strand of a larger problem with Coffmann: a very narrow view of what is and isn't notable. Would he care to venture a guess, as to how many captains were awarded the KC for the command of a capital ship in battle? <a href="/wiki/User:Dapi89" title="User:Dapi89">Dapi89</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Dapi89" title="User talk:Dapi89">talk</a>) 09:33, 1 April 2017 (UTC)

<dd>Range, born 1955, is a former Bundeswehr officer turned journalist and well known for his far right political stand. His recent publications have been thrashed by historians for inaccuracy, bias and distortions of historical facts.

<p>I consider the information on the Rudel article that user K.e.coffman has considered "trivial" to be actually at least as important, if not more so, than the subject's WWII service. So if a recipient of an award was 94th, so what? If he was 10007, so what. As for including whether someone was the 94th or the 93rd, can you tell me why this is NOT relevant? We note that a person graduated 286 in a class of 500, is that any less relevant? This is part of a larger "crusade", I suspect, to discredit a series of articles about military personnel in WWII in Germany. The service of Germans in their country's war is a fact. The award of medals is a fact. This are not alternative facts, regardless of who publishes the information.

<li>I am interested in evidence as to the status of the publishing house and the author; I have not found any though this is sometimes difficult to track down with German publishing houses. I am troubled by a few things--<a href="/wiki/User:Dapi89" title="User:Dapi89">User:Dapi89</a>'s accusation of a "crusade", a charge repeated by <a href="/wiki/User:Auntieruth55" title="User:Auntieruth55">User:Auntieruth55</a>, whose scare quotes do nothing to alleviate the lack of good faith. And I don't understand a few of the comments in this last section--"So if a recipient of an award was 94th, so what?" doesn't make a lot of sense after it was stated that the information is "at least as important" as the person's service. And that someone graduated 286 in a class of 500, I have never seen that noted in an article, though I grant that I don't MilHist much. Anyway, I've seen K.e.coffman's work, and I have never had a reason to doubt their good intentions; I would appreciate it if you all could drop the "crusade" language, since it only discredits the person using the term. <a href="/wiki/User:Drmies" title="User:Drmies">Drmies</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Drmies" title="User talk:Drmies">talk</a>) 15:59, 11 April 2017 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The 'so what' I believe is in reference to it being an uncontentious piece of information. The fact he is recipient of the award is not in doubt, Coffman however is saying the sourcing provided is not reliable to state the fact that he was the '94' recipient. Ultimately unless you are the first or last recipient of almost all awards, you are just a link in the chain of winners, so it really is not important if they were 94th, 95th, 105th etc. If the fact of the award is not disputed, I have not seen any evidence above the source is not reliable to say they were the 94th. If they are a right-wing publisher, then you can expect them to have done some research on right-wing figures. Its not beyond the realms of feasibility they might puff up subjects *where there is a benefit in doing so*. I cant see any reason it would be biased or romanticising to say "Subject X was the 94th recipient of award Y" over "Subject X was the recipient of award Y". Where is the motivation? If people are going to argue a source's political stance influences their reliability, you need to actually make a credible argument there is a *reason* for them to publish unreliable material. <a href="/wiki/User:Only_in_death" title="User:Only in death">Only in death does duty end</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Only_in_death" title="User talk:Only in death">talk</a>) 16:29, 11 April 2017 (UTC)

<li>K.e.coffman, I read that article yesterday or the day before (I think it's linked from the German article on Range?), and it's not enough for me to make such a condemnation that the material would be unreliable, though it's clear that the tone of his writing is indeed ... fishy.

<dd>On the one hand: That book by Range, published when he was only 19 years of age, is bad. It's biased to the extreme (Range uses peacock words to describe Lindemann in nearly every sentence: <i>vorbildlich, besonnen, erfolgreich</i> = exemplary, considerate, successful) and it does not contain much information anyway. I cannot imagine that a historian would refer to that work while writing about Lindemann. The same information, that he was the 94th recipient, could easily be referenced with Manfred Dörr (1996), <i>Ritterkreuzträger der Überwasserstreitkräfte</i>, vol. 2, already being used in the article. So, as was pointed out very early on, one question is sourcing, the other inclusion. The first could be resolved quickly, although I am not sure, if there isn't an interest to keep Range as a source anyway. The second touches upon <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:DUE" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:DUE">WP:DUE</a>. These kind of articles, i.e. articles dealing with Knight's Cross recipients, are stuffed with small details. Those details lend authenticity to a narrative which actually distracts from the violence of war. The article features a whole chapter on the <i>Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross</i>, but skips over the fact that Lütjens and Lindemann, following Erich Raeder's order, were responsible for the hopeless final fight and thus for the death of most of their crew. (Holger Afflerbach: <i>"Mit wehender Fahne untergehen"</i>. In: <i>VfZ</i> 49 (2001), p. 609.) Sure, that's the usual German military glory stuff of Wikipedia. But if "romancing" is to be critically discussed at some point, it has to include a discussion of how "facts" are selected and how they are presented. Such insight is completely missing with many of the MilHistProject.--<a href="/wiki/User:Assayer" title="User:Assayer">Assayer</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Assayer" title="User talk:Assayer">talk</a>) 19:46, 13 April 2017 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Reading this thread was a headache. Everyone, please keep to the point. '94th' is only published in one book, that book is not a reliable source, and so '94' should not be included. There is no reason to discuss triviality or notability of the fact, or predisposition of editors. There is nothing in <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RS">WP:RS</a> that discusses pulling facts that are probably true from unreliable sources just because the unreliable source is unlikely to fabricate that particular point. WP:RS is clear, the source must be reliable for the fact to be verifiable. "Articles should be based on reliable, third-party, published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy." Does this source have a reputation for fact checking and accuracy? If not, strike the 94, and move on. <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/2604:6000:7B0E:8C00:B91F:4407:3AF6:3B15" title="Special:Contributions/2604:6000:7B0E:8C00:B91F:4407:3AF6:3B15">2604:6000:7B0E:8C00:B91F:4407:3AF6:3B15</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:2604:6000:7B0E:8C00:B91F:4407:3AF6:3B15&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:2604:6000:7B0E:8C00:B91F:4407:3AF6:3B15 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 04:40, 30 June 2017 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Previous discussion <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Black_supremacy#Not_racism.3F">here</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Black_supremacy" title="Black supremacy">black supremacy</a> page carefully avoids labelling it as a racist ideology while the <a href="/wiki/White_supremacy" title="White supremacy">white supremacy</a> page is not shy about mentioning it. Here is where I added the <a href="/wiki/Template:Racism_topics" title="Template:Racism topics">racism template</a>: <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_supremacy&amp;diff=792951241&amp;oldid=791505159">diff</a>. The subsequent edit shows it being removed, then re-added by me because I noted that the article was included in that template, and then removed again because the article had subsequently been removed from the template. Here are some basic facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The definition of <a class="external text" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/white_supremacy">white supremacy</a> is "The ideology which holds that the white race is superior to all others."</li>
<li>The definition of <a class="external text" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/black_supremacy">black supremacy</a> is "The ideology which holds that the black race is <b>superior to all others</b>."</li>
<li>The page itself is already "Part of a series on <b>Discrimination'</b>".</li>
<li>The definition of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/racism">racism</a>, according to Oxford Dictionary, is "Prejudice, <b>discrimination</b>, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the <b>belief that one's own race is superior</b>."</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's some additional sources: The SPLC <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2008/racist-black-hebrew-israelites-becoming-more-militant">article</a> linked on the black supremacy page has "racist" as the first word in the headline, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/07/21/white-people-think-racism-is-getting-worse-against-white-people/">WaPo</a> which links to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.people.hbs.edu/mnorton/norton%20sommers.pdf">this study</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/z4y4aw/meet-the-black-supremacists-hunting-the-white-devil">Viceland</a>, and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/gallup-racism-against-whites-surges/article/2599545">Washington Examiner</a> that links to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/194657/six-americans-say-racism-against-blacks-widespread.aspx">a Gallup poll</a>.

<dd>This is just stupid. More than two years ago I broke the false equivalency that held—without a single reliable source—that the opening sentences of <a href="/wiki/Black_supremacy" title="Black supremacy">Black supremacy</a> and <a href="/wiki/White_supremacy" title="White supremacy">White supremacy</a> had to be mirror images of one another. In truth, there are no <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a> that anybody has found in two years that assert that black supremacy is racist. But like clockwork, every few months somebody gets his nose out of joint because Wikipedia doesn't say that black supremacy is racist. When I (or other editors) ask them to produce reliable sources, we always get the same song and dance routine: look at the dictionary, it's a textbook example, etc. I'm sorry, but it's not POV to correctly reflect what reliable sources say about a subject and <i>refuse</i> to engage in <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NOR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NOR">original research</a> because it suits the whims of the Fox News crowd.

<p>Ugh, not this again - the issue has been discussed to death, just look at the talk page archives. What some editors think is "obvious" notwithstanding, there is a lack of RS which describe black supremacy as a racist concept/ideology. That's really all there is to say.

<dd>The SPLC article linked above clearly labels it as racism, and if we are to write <span class="inline-quote-talk" style="font-family: Georgia, 'DejaVu Serif', serif; color: #008560;">Black supremacy or black supremacism is a racial supremacist belief that black people are superior to people of other races</span>, then we are basically calling it racism and should call a spade a spade.

<dd>I wish people would read the archives. Every X months somebody insists we have to say the same as the white supremacy article, it's a false equivalence. Some of these orgs are very odd and sometimes pretty nasty in their beliefs. Most are extremely fringe, sometimes it isn't even clear that they are more than rhetorically supremacist. Visiting editors don't seem to care about any of that, as long as we use the same language for both white and black.

<dd>The picture I'm getting of this topic is that, while we have one source that identifies an obviously racist ideology (the SPLC), we don't have independent secondary sources. Thus we cannot "Call a spade a spade", because no one has really bothered to do that. But this is precisely the domain of the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:GNG" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:GNG">general notability guideline</a> that, in tandem with other policies like <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:PSTS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:PSTS">WP:PSTS</a>, allows us to enforce this aspect of the neutral point of view: if there aren't independent sources about something, we shouldn't have an article about it. I would point out that <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:FRINGE" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:FRINGE">WP:FRINGE</a> is also clearly relevant here (far more than it would be for a more well-studied concept like <a href="/wiki/White_supremacy" title="White supremacy">white supremacy</a>). I think that, if anyone wants to keep this article, it should be rewritten to include studies independent of those commissioned by the SPLC, preferably in reliable secondary sources.

<dd>I suspect gaining consensus on a topic like this will be near impossible in a medium such as WP but still, we must try. In that vein, let's flip the question: <b>(1)</b> If black supremacy is NOT racist, then define it for us; <b>(2)</b> Aside from the obvious, what differentiates black supremacy from white supremacy? Also, we cannot just summarily state that "black supremacy" denotes de facto racism because it shares the word supremacy with "white supremacy". I understand the impulse to do this but regardless, we need to follow the policies re: good and solid sourcing from several respected entities. It may very well be that the term does not enjoy widespread use in current society and if not, then finding source material will be challenging to say the least. <a href="/wiki/User:Aleding" title="User:Aleding">airuditious</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Aleding" title="User talk:Aleding">talk</a>) 23:11, 19 August 2017 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, Kwame Appiah (a widely cited philosopher on racism, although as is often the case with analytic philosophers, someone whose definitions are not widely used) offers this explanation:
<dl>
<dd>'Part of our resistance, therefore, to calling the racial ideas of those, such as the Black Nationalists of the 1960s, who advocate racial solidarity, by the same term that we use to describe the attitudes of Nazis or of members of the South African Nationalist party, surely resides in the fact that they largely did not contemplate using race as a basis for inflicting harm." ("Racisms" in David T. Goldberg, ed., <i>The Anatomy of Racism</i>)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Both legal and social scientific definitions of <a href="/wiki/Racism#Legal" title="Racism">racism</a> show a concern with effects in defining racism. The UN requires that to be racism, something must have "the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing … human rights and fundamental freedoms." Likewise, social scientific definitions of racism that differentiate between racial prejudice and racism as an institutional system of advantage. (The simplest of these is <a href="/wiki/Prejudice_plus_power" title="Prejudice plus power">Prejudice plus power</a>, but there are plenty others.) That is, many analysts have refused to see the person subordinated by race, who hates the race of his/her oppressor and believes in his/her race's superior moral worth, in spite of its present conditions as belonging to the same category as the person who imposes that vision of racial inferiority upon him/her. On "Black Supremacy" in particular, Eduardo Bonilla-Silva writes:
<dl>
<dd>[Racism is] about a social system partially organized around the logic of racial superiority. Thus, if the United States was partially organized around the logic of black supremacy, then I would work hard to understand its coordinates and deconstruct its mythologies. Yet, as I think most whites would admit if they talk honestly about racial matters, this country is not even remotely organized around the logic of black supremacy. What we have in the country at worst is a few black leaders who exhibit defensive prejudice (“You called me ugly. You are the really ugly one!”). But none of these leaders has either the capacity or the desire to develop a social movement to impose such logic on the country." (<i>Racism without Racists: Color-Blind Racism and the Persistence of Racial Inequality in the United States</i>)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>You have this, you have Appiah saying its morally different than racism, you can find James Baldwin calling it a mythology (perhaps "a dangerous myth") to morally encourage people surviving oppression. Now if you want to source all these perspectives and include X says its a racist ideology, that would be great. But NPOV requires attribution and consideration of this diversity of views.--<a href="/wiki/User:Carwil" title="User:Carwil">Carwil</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Carwil" title="User talk:Carwil">talk</a>) 15:02, 2 September 2017 (UTC)

<dd>Academics generally separate editorial and opinion stuff from scholarly stuff. His works on "racism without racists" and similar works still stands as peer-reviewed work. You can't discredit him because of his signing that statement. Within social science, it's a mainstream viewpoint that racism requires power to act upon prejudice. Many would reject the notion that white supremacy and black supremacy are parallel or symmetric as white supremacy was developed to justify chattel slavery whereas black supremacy was developed in response to it, to resist it.

<p><i>This issue affects &gt;2000 articles mostly in <a href="/wiki/Category:Cornwall" title="Category:Cornwall">Category:Cornwall</a> and sub-categories.</i></p>
<p>I need assistance from an uninvolved person (someone who does not live in <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Cornwall" title="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>, preferably a non-British person) in a seemingly endless war over how Cornwall should be described in article lede sections. basically there are two options each prefered by a different group.</p>

However in 2014 [<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.ft.com/content/9428e8c6-cb97-11e3-8ccf-00144feabdc0">[10]</a>] the UK government offically recognised Cornwall as a distinct region, in line with Option 2, which was previously dissmissed due to <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:BIAS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:BIAS">systematic bias</a> against what have been generally reffered to as 'Cornish Nationalists'. I have actually explained this elsewhere, <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTENGLAND" title="Wikipedia:NOTENGLAND">Exhibit C1</a>, <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Aguyintobooks/Archive_1#Cornwall_places" title="User talk:Aguyintobooks/Archive 1">Exhibit D2</a>.<br />

<dd>They (or to be precise the EU, then the government) simply recognised the Cornish people as "<i>having a national identity equal to that of the Welsh, Scottish or Northern Irish peoples</i>". The government doesn't recognise England as a nation anyway, so the issue didn't extend beyond a Cornwall --&gt; United Kingdom issue. All that actually then happened was some devolution to Cornwall Council (beyond that of most countries) and the EU granted some funding (Cornwall gets around 40% more EU funding that most counties.

<dd>Point of clarification needed here. The UK government does <i>not</i>, and never has, "recognised Cornwall as a distinct region". It certainly recognises the Cornish <i>people</i> as a distinct minority group (<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cornish-granted-minority-status-within-the-uk">[11]</a>), but that is by no means the same thing as recognising the geographical area of Cornwall as a distinct <i>region</i>. Administratively within the UK, Cornwall is treated as part of <a href="/wiki/South_West_England" title="South West England">South West England</a>, one of the nine official <a href="/wiki/Regions_of_England" title="Regions of England">regions of England</a>. <a href="/wiki/User:Ghmyrtle" title="User:Ghmyrtle">Ghmyrtle</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ghmyrtle" title="User talk:Ghmyrtle">talk</a>) 19:35, 10 September 2017 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Officially those 9 regions are the largest subdivision below UK level. The point is that England and Cornwall as regions have exactly the same amount of Government recognition - none. Hence the difficulty. Various calls for English devolution and an English parliament are constantly rejected. <a href="/wiki/User:Aguyintobooks" title="User:Aguyintobooks"><font color="green"><u><b>Α&#160;Guy&#160;into&#160;Books</b></u>™</font></a>&#160;<a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Aguyintobooks" title="Special:Contributions/Aguyintobooks">§</a>&#160;(<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Aguyintobooks" title="User talk:Aguyintobooks"><span style="color: purple"><i>Message</i></span></a>)&#160;-&#160; 19:43, 10 September 2017 (UTC)

<dd>That's something of a red herring in this context. England is fully recognised in official government documents as one of the four nations within the UK, with its own distinctive legislative and administrative arrangements (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pisa-2015-national-report-for-england">one example</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/ukgeographies/administrativegeography/england#england">another</a>). Specifically, it now has a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/bills/public/english-votes-for-english-laws/">Legislative Grand Committee</a> within the UK Parliament to discuss matters pertaining to the whole of England, including Cornwall. <a href="/wiki/User:Ghmyrtle" title="User:Ghmyrtle">Ghmyrtle</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ghmyrtle" title="User talk:Ghmyrtle">talk</a>) 19:57, 10 September 2017 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Agreeing with the above that a) this noticeboard might not be the best place for such a discussion (it will attract neutral opinion but as the interested parties haven't been reached any outcome isn't going to have much weight) and b) this is not something worth changing in existing articles. Still, I'm venturing to throw in my 2p (bearing in mind that there's usually no need to link commonly known words):
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Cornwall" title="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>, United Kingdom. This is is a bit confusing: I'm used to seeing something along the lines of <a href="/wiki/Devon" title="Devon">Devon</a>, <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a>. Omitting <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a> and including <a href="/wiki/UK" class="mw-redirect" title="UK">UK</a> <i>could</i> confuse readers, or wrongly imply that Cornwall is a country on par with England or Wales.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Cornwall" title="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>, England, United Kingdom. This is redundant: unlike say <a href="/wiki/Wales" title="Wales">Wales</a>, the entity of England is more widely known and easily recognised than the entity of the UK, so there's no need to list the UK.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Cornwall" title="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>, England. This seems like the most sensible solution, but this does seem to get into an area that's sensible for some people. Are they a minority? Probably, but they're also disproportionately more likely to be the ones who care enough to write about Cornwall topics, but that's a systemic bias that it's really difficult to work around. – <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Uanfala" title="User talk:Uanfala">Uanfala</a> 20:44, 10 September 2017 (UTC)</li>

<p>Santiago Maldonado is a <a href="/wiki/Missing_person" title="Missing person">missing person</a> in Argentina since a month ago, when the police dispersed a picketing protest in the Patagonia. There is a great political controversy in Argentina about it, the <a href="/wiki/Santiago_Maldonado_case" title="Santiago Maldonado case">Santiago Maldonado case</a>. There is a judicial case, and several open lines of investigation: that he was seized and forcibly dissapeared by the Gendarmerie, that he escaped to Chile, that a farm worker killed him during a robbery some days before that, etc. None of the options really have very strong evidences, but the first one raises a lot of controversy, because of the political connotations. Things are murked even further because midterm elections in Argentina will take place next month (Cristina Kirchner, leader of the opposition, tries to blame president Macri for all this, and focus her political rallies on that point), and the protest was organized by the <a href="/wiki/Resistencia_Ancestral_Mapuche" title="Resistencia Ancestral Mapuche">Resistencia Ancestral Mapuche</a> (RAM), a separatist group that engages in many radical actions.</p>
<p>I started the article using some international sources (The Guardian, BBC) and the mainstream newspaper of Argentina, Clarín, for the more specific details. See <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Santiago_Maldonado_case&amp;oldid=798196082">here</a> for an older version of the article. Then, two new users, <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:EvaristoDLR&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:EvaristoDLR (page does not exist)">EvaristoDLR</a> and <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:EMans&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:EMans (page does not exist)">EMans</a>, started to change the article using several questionable sources. I ceased trying to fix the article and tried to solve it in the talk, but so far it has been pointless.</p>
<p>The main point in conflict: in my version, the article does not fully accept nor refute any of the theories, and lists what does each one says and which evidence is there for and against it. In their version, the current one, the forced disapearance is the only theory still standing, and the others are listed as "disproven". Problem is, the judiciary is still investigation those theories, so they are not disproven yet. And the evidence against the forced disapearance theory is just as strong as the evidence against the other theories. See <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/02/world/americas/argentina-protests-santiago-maldonado.html">The New York Times</a>, that describes the political controversy, but when it goes to the case itself, it points that "Santiago Maldonado’s case is being investigated as a forced disappearance, but the prosecutor in charge of the investigation has said no evidence has emerged to date that security forces took him into custody".</p>
<p>There <i>were</i> some reported sights that were eventually disproven, but this leads to another problem in the article: in the "reactions" section, it is outright stated that there is a conspiracy between the government and the mainstream media, who would have had fabricated those sights in order to derail the investigation (of course, except for speculations there is absolutely zero evidence of that, as with all conspiracy theories). All referenced just in tiny pro-Kirchnerite newspapers and glorified blogs, of course. <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AResistencia_Ancestral_Mapuche&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=798902563&amp;oldid=797355980">Here</a> things are taken even further: there is no RAM, it's all just a set up organized by the government and the media to frame the mapuches and make them look bad. You know, all those mapuches that appear here and there from time to time and make violent acts of vandalism while asking for the independence of the mapuche nation, are just costumed guys from the intelligence agencies. It's them who say that, not me...</p>
<p>Note, by the way, that my time for wikipedia editing is a bit limited. I had not expanded the article as much as I should because those users intervened almost immediatey, and all the time I spent trying to fix or remove their edits and discussing with them is time that I could not use to edit the article.</p>
<p>What should we do here? Should we use just major mainstream sources, as I proposed? Should we limit things to international sources from English-speaking countries? Or should we include those minor sources and their conspiracy theories as well? Should we treat all theories as similarily valid until the judiciary officialy rejects them, or is a criticism from a given source enough to treat a theory as "disproven"? <a href="/wiki/User:Cambalachero" title="User:Cambalachero">Cambalachero</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Cambalachero" title="User talk:Cambalachero">talk</a>) 19:06, 4 September 2017 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is currect, the murder theory has been debunked, just a couple of hours after I started this thread. However, as EMans should probably know, those where not the only theories being investigated (as I mentioned, my time for wikipedia editing is a bit limited). <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.clarin.com/politica/claves-caso-hipotesis-empiezan-descartar_0_HJR9UvsKW.html">This news report</a>, written after those results, clarifies the current status of the investigation: the main open lines of investigation are the forced disapearance, and that Maldonado would be hiding himself. So, my concerns with the article remain the same: when can't simply call it a forced disapearance as if it was a confirmed fact when it isn't, and the conspiracy theories are still conspiracy theories.</dd>
<dd>As for the rest, this is a textbook case. I say that there is very little evidence to consider it a forced disapearance. Source: the new york times. He says that it is a confirmed forced disapearance. Source: the judicial case itself. Meaning, a primary source. There's a reason we do not use those: because it's easy to misunderstand them. Which is the case here. The case is still an open investigation and has not reached that veredict. In fact, <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Santiago_Maldonado_case&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=798196252&amp;oldid=798196160">this info</a> was removed from the article: that the case started as a search and rescue investigation, and then it was rebranded as a forced disappearance investigation <b>without any new evidence to justify such a change</b>. So, the mere folder title is a bit meaningless. Specially when, unlike EMans remarks above, the investigation itself is unaffected by it, and all the open lines of investigation kept being equally investigated before and after such change.</dd>
<dd>In any case, I already know EMans opinion. I would like to hear the opinion and advises of some other uninvolved and regular editor, to help to solve this. <a href="/wiki/User:Cambalachero" title="User:Cambalachero">Cambalachero</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Cambalachero" title="User talk:Cambalachero">talk</a>) 12:35, 5 September 2017 (UTC)</dd>

It's the news agency of the Supreme Court, as you can see <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.cij.gov.ar/inicio.html">here</a>. Therefore, like any other news agency, it's a secondary source.</li>
<li>The only line of investigation it's the "forced disapearance".

<li>If some media maintains that Santiago Maldonado is hiding, it can be added to the article, at the moment it's not. Clarifying that they are not data on the part of the justice but of media close to the national government.</li>

<dd>I know you know my opinion, the problem is that if you ask for advice while providing false information. Advice will not serve much.</dd>
<dd>Having said that, no objection has been raised (for what I am seeing) for the neutrality of the article. In this there is a hypothesis and two that have been debunked. There are more hypotheses, some more weirds than others, like the one that links the artisan to the Colombian's FARC. Maybe not all have to go to the article, but if the user did not include them it I don't understood why instead of doing it comes here.--<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:EMans&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:EMans (page does not exist)">EMans</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:EMans" title="User talk:EMans">talk</a>) 17:00, 5 September 2017 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is no problem finding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RS">reliable</a> sources that clearly refer to these political organizations as "right-wing", they are all mainstream parties with reasonable popular support from moderate right voters. I suspect the disagreement is purely based on the meaning of "far-right". Which in the UK for instance is basically a synonym for "extreme neo-nazi". Clearly the mainstream nature of these organizations means they make every effort to avoid being extreme (or more importantly, seen as extreme) to avoid losing votes. I would recommend "right wing", as an article about <a href="/wiki/Steve_Bannon" title="Steve Bannon">Steve Bannon</a> with (possible?) links to white supremacy / KKK groups, risks implying these other organizations are likewise white supremacy / extreme groups by using related wording. However if the sentence was qualified to make it clear they were not comparable to the KKK, and are legitimate mainstream political parties, then I suppose it would be acceptable to refer to them as far-right. The only issue is then to avoid over-complicating the paragraph in explaining this, which leads back to using the more moderate wording. <a href="/wiki/User:Aguyintobooks" title="User:Aguyintobooks">A Guy into Books</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Aguyintobooks" title="User talk:Aguyintobooks">talk</a>) 13:09, 6 September 2017 (UTC)

<dd>"Bannon’s support for European far-right parties runs far deeper than his interest in Marion Maréchal-Le Pen or the National Front. He brags about his international Breitbart operation as “the platform” for the American alt-right, and has for years been thinking globally, with an affinity for the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), Alternative for Germany (AfD), and the Party for Freedom Party (PVV) in the Netherlands, all of which have earned glowing coverage on the pages of Breitbart."

<dd>Appreciated. I'm still not seeing a explicit statement that UKIP <u>is</u> factually "far right". I will allow that there is an <i>implication</i> of such, but that it not sufficient (per <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:V" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:SYNTH" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:SYNTH">WP:SYNTH</a>) for us to make a direct statement. I do concur that the Daily Beast requires attribution; it is an analysis piece, and these are not a simple statements of undisputed fact. I will go further and suggest that any such attribution needs to be for both the "Bannon is supportive of ..." and for any implication that UKIP is "far right". I also note that this is a passing mention of UKIP, which is not the main subject of the article (which intersects with <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RSCONTEXT" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RSCONTEXT">WP:RSCONTEXT</a>, further impacting potential reliability for statements of fact); and that (per <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:DUE" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:DUE">WP:DUE</a>), with alternative viewpoints available (particularly the description of "right wing" only), we need to examine the prominence of the "far right" viewpoint in reliable sources. With the sourcing provided thus far, it seems to be solidly a minority viewpoint at best. - <a href="/wiki/User:Ryk72" title="User:Ryk72">Ryk72</a> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ryk72" title="User talk:Ryk72">'c.s.n.s.'</a></sup> 14:28, 6 September 2017 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree they aren't making a clear factual statement, but the tone and approach makes you want to take their words that "far-right" applies to UKIP + others. Hence why I think attribution is needed. I definitely wouldn't use that source alone to factually claim the UKIP was far-right. As to what other sources exist, I don't know but would agree more would be helpful. A spot check ("bannon europe ukip far-right") shows some possible RSes to support this but haven't gone into detail. --<a href="/wiki/User:Masem" title="User:Masem">M<font size="-3">ASEM</font></a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Masem" title="User talk:Masem">t</a>) 14:32, 6 September 2017 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I believe that to define <b>all</b> those parties as far-right would need more than one RS, in general usage, UKIP is right-wing, a Gsearch for "UKIP far-right" (with or without quotes), shows that UKIP and the Far-Right are considered separate in most reliable sources. Also i see no proposals which deal with my initial concerns. <a href="/wiki/User:Aguyintobooks" title="User:Aguyintobooks">A Guy into Books</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Aguyintobooks" title="User talk:Aguyintobooks">talk</a>) 14:45, 6 September 2017 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is a dispute between <a href="/wiki/User:Kautilya3" title="User:Kautilya3">User:Kautilya3</a> and myself. Kautilya3 has done lots of commendable work on the article <a href="/wiki/Doklam" title="Doklam">Doklam</a>, which was the site of the <a href="/wiki/2017_China%E2%80%93India_border_standoff" title="2017 China–India border standoff">2017 China–India border standoff</a>. I've not edited either article, but I feel that both have been edited in a way that heavily relies on scholars and media of India, a country directly involved in the dispute. I was also alarmed when Kautilya3 claimed that the renowned scholars <a href="/wiki/Neville_Maxwell" title="Neville Maxwell">Neville Maxwell</a> and Alastair Lamb were biased, while the Indian scholar Parshotam Mehra was "disinterested" (see <a href="/wiki/Talk:Doklam#Neville_Maxwell_fact_check" title="Talk:Doklam">Talk:Doklam#Neville Maxwell fact check</a> and <a href="/wiki/Talk:Sino-Indian_War#W._H._Johnson" title="Talk:Sino-Indian War">Talk:Sino-Indian War#W. H. Johnson</a>). Kautilya3 then brought the discussion to my talk page (see <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Zanhe#Nationality-based_arguments" title="User talk:Zanhe">User talk:Zanhe#Nationality-based arguments</a>), but we could not reach an agreement.</p>
<p>In summary, my position is that</p>
<ul>
<li><b>A</b>. Sources from a country directly involved in a conflict should be presumed to be non-neutral unless proven otherwise; they should be avoided if there are reliables alternatives from neutral countries (Western scholarship in this case). Or if truly unavoidable, they should be attributed per <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Biased" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Biased">WP:Biased</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kautilya3's position is that</p>
<ul>
<li><b>B</b>. A source's nationality/country of origin is irrelevant, even if the country is directly involved in a dispute. <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:BIASED" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:BIASED">WP:BIASED</a> says "Common sources of bias include political, financial, religious, philosophical, or other beliefs". Nationality is not mentioned.</li>

<dd>Neutrality is a requirement of Wikipedia articles, not sources. What matters is reliability. You have to determine the relative weight given to different views expressed in reliable sources and ensure that weight is reflected in the article.

<li>The nationality of the author or publication does not determine reliability.

<dd>I agree with regentspark that "We don't ascribe biases to scholars based on their nationality unless reliable sources do so." If there is a difference of opinion along national lines, and that's in the sources (e.g., a scholarly work says "On topic X, Chinese writers have tended to say Y, but Japanese sources have tended to say Z") we can say so.

<li>Both A and B are somewhat wrong. TFD, Neutrality and slatersteven all made good points. Wrong with A: Unless we are talking about government or plainly political sources I don't see how the nationality of a source directly determines its reliability in this circumstance. Wrong with B: "Nationalist" should probably be added to the list of beliefs that are common sources of bias. Wrong with both: If a source has a bias (don't all sources have some bias?) it just needs to be weighted and balanced, and perhaps attributed in text. <a href="/wiki/User:DIYeditor" title="User:DIYeditor">—DIYeditor</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:DIYeditor" title="User talk:DIYeditor">talk</a>) 17:19, 10 September 2017 (UTC)</li>
<li>It depends. Sometimes 3rd country sources are clueless and shallow. Othertimes you have bias and taking sides also in 3rd country sources (either per author's bias, or a systemic bias - e.g. Western sources are anti-Russian in regards to Ukraine (which essentially flipped out of the Russian sphere)). It is best to represent the views of all involved in the conflict, and sometimes it is better to rely on in country sources from both sides. The author being in a 3rd country does not mean no bias.<a href="/wiki/User:Icewhiz" title="User:Icewhiz">Icewhiz</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Icewhiz" title="User talk:Icewhiz">talk</a>) 20:38, 11 September 2017 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Malik Shabazz: I asked specifically about the "Allah" comment sourced to the CBC among others. Of the 4 links you provided 3 don't address it at all and the 4th, the current talk page discussion, only addresses it indirectly with objections to "weight." As the "Allah" comment has more coverage than many statements currently included (or example Bars4Justice, the condemnation of Christie's criticism, the assault of a BLM activist in Birmingham,&#160;Goldberg's criticism of "All Lives Matter", the Essence magazine cover, etc.) the objection to "weight" is not persuasive. <a href="/wiki/User:James_J._Lambden" title="User:James J.

<p><b>Comment</b> The article doesn't mention the views of any other chapter co-founder, nor does it quote several far more notable BLM organizers. It's misleading to give more emphasis to the views of this person (a co-founder of a chapter) than we give to someone like Opal Tometi (a movement founder). I think Saturnalia has <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Black_Lives_Matter&amp;diff=795868466&amp;oldid=795818622">more or less acknowledged</a> that some of these statements could be seen as contradictory to the stated goals of BLM, but that's precisely why it's misleading to place outsize focus on this person. If the goal is to include a criticism of BLM, I'm all for it, but the best way to do that is by citing a notable critique from a notable critic. Not by cherry-picking statements to imply that BLM is racist without stating it directly. Aside from the due weight issues, the proposed revision uses weasel words and there are sourcing and relevance issues for the "sub-human" stuff. <a href="/wiki/User:Nblund" title="User:Nblund"><span style="background-color: #CC79A7; color:white;"><b>Nblund</b></span></a> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Nblund" title="User talk:Nblund">talk</a></sup> 16:55, 10 September 2017 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Edit</b> I must have missed this, but the "allah" and "sub-human" quotes both come from Khogali's personal social media accounts, they weren't made in relation to a BLM event, or in any sort of "official" capacity as a BLM organizer. It's really a major stretch to insist that months old statements from the Twitter account of one organizer are helpful for understanding BLM Toronto. FWIW, the "White supremacist terrorist" quote was a comment made at a BLM protest, so it is more plausibly relevant. <a href="/wiki/User:Nblund" title="User:Nblund"><span style="background-color: #CC79A7; color:white;"><b>Nblund</b></span></a> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Nblund" title="User talk:Nblund">talk</a></sup> 17:22, 10 September 2017 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If other co-chapter founders' comments aren't covered it's because RS haven't found them worthy. Picking one founder or one comment is not cherry-picking when RS do the picking.</dd>
<dd>The relevance of personal vs professional twitter, the notability of critics (which is relevant when the publication is non-notable, not the case here), etc. are irrelevant to discussions of weight.

<dd>As you wrote, Saturnalia0 has asserted that the comments are at odds with the stated goals of BLM, but that only indicates he hasn't the foggiest notion what those goals are. They do not include holding hands and singing Kumbaya and pretending that racism is a thing of the past—they are concerned with ending police violence against black people, empowering black people, and ending police violence against black people. And no, that wasn't a mistake. For gods sake, the name of the group is <b>Black Lives Matter</b>, not the Coalition for Equal Rights. —&#160;<a href="/wiki/User:Malik_Shabazz" title="User:Malik Shabazz">Malik Shabazz</a>&#160;<sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Malik_Shabazz" title="User talk:Malik Shabazz">Talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Malik_Shabazz" title="Special:Contributions/Malik Shabazz">Stalk</a></sub> 22:56, 10 September 2017 (UTC)

<dd>If this comment was in response to mine I did not address what Saturnalia0 wrote and I'm not interested in his or anyone's notions about BLM. My point is straightforward: something happened which relates to BLM <i>according to multiple RS</i>. It was covered <i>in multiple RS.</i> It should be included in our article <i>because it was covered in multiple RS.</i> <a href="/wiki/User:James_J._Lambden" title="User:James J. Lambden">James J.

<dd><span class="template-ping">@<a href="/wiki/User:James_J._Lambden" title="User:James J. Lambden">James J. Lambden</a>:</span>: I think you misread me. I said the movement founders aren't covered <i>in the entry</i>. You can find lots of discussion of Opal Tometi's views on the goals of BLM in reliable sources (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://time.com/4463742/opal-tometi-american-voices/">ex</a>), the same is true of Alicia Garza and DeRay McKesson.</dd>
<dd>Also: it sounds like you're suggesting that relevance doesn't matter for due weight. That would be a tortured interpretation, at best. A widely covered fact can still be undue if you try to place it where it is only tangentially relevant to the topic. Tom Brady's views on Trump would be fine on his entry, but probably <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:UNDUE" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:UNDUE">WP:UNDUE</a> for the entry on the <a href="/wiki/New_England_Patriots" title="New England Patriots">New England Patriots</a>. <a href="/wiki/User:Nblund" title="User:Nblund"><span style="background-color: #CC79A7; color:white;"><b>Nblund</b></span></a> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Nblund" title="User talk:Nblund">talk</a></sup> 02:58, 11 September 2017 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, as I said in my reply to Malik: relevance matters and relevance is determined by RS. If Tometi's views are widely covered in the context of BLM we should include them. If he has his own article they're most appropriate there, if not, here.</dd>
<dd>The arguments and requirements for inclusion for this particular piece of information seem arbitrary. I suspect if the head of an NRA chapter said something along the lines of "Please Jesus give me the strength not to kill black people" and it were well covered in RS the debate would be how prominently to include it in the lede rather than whether we include it at all. Incidentally I've found another source for the Trudeau/White Supremacist comment <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/nzd4px/black-lives-matter-toronto-called-justin-trudeau-a-white-supremacist-terrorist">[20]</a> <a href="/wiki/User:James_J._Lambden" title="User:James J.

<dd>Tometi's views are widely covered in the context of BLM, she is considered to be one of the founders of the movement. Khogali isn't mentioned as an important founder or leader or BLM, she isn't really discussed at all outside of the context of these two comments. None of these sources suggest that her views are representative of BLM or even of BLM Toronto. She's indisputably less important for BLM than Tometi.</dd>
<dd>The NRA page is a great example: Ted Nugent is a member of the NRA national board. He once called Obama a "subhuman mongrel" and came close enough to threatening to kill him that he earned a visit from the secret service.

<dd>I was going to make a point on this, but Nblund's captured what I think is important. It would be one thing if the comments came from the top-most leadership of the organization, the ones that are driving its goals for the entire body, but that's not the case here. It is putting undue weight on one member who does not speak for the entire organization. --<a href="/wiki/User:Masem" title="User:Masem">M<font size="-3">ASEM</font></a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Masem" title="User talk:Masem">t</a>) 14:14, 11 September 2017 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The 1970 shooting deaths of <a href="/wiki/Fred_Hampton" title="Fred Hampton">Fred Hampton</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mark_Clark_(activist)" title="Mark Clark (activist)">Mark Clark</a> in Chicago were originally ruled "justifiable homicide" by a coroner's jury; however, a lengthy lawsuit by their relatives was settled for a sizeable amount of money by the federal, state, and city governments. AFAIK, there was no admission of wrong-doing. I have added cited material indicating that the circumstances surrounding their deaths is controversial and that some people believe (with some justification, IMHO) that they were deliberately/intentionally killed (i.e. murdered or assassinated) by law enforcement. Given that the terms "murder" and "assassination" are used frequently in those articles without attribution, I have {{POV}} tagged both articles. Given that there have been similar shootings and similar public responses in more recent history, I am hoping someone with experiencing editing those types of articles might want to take a look at these two.

<dd>I don't have a lot of experience editing this kind of article, but I would definitely say "killed" if there is any uncertainty about wether this was justifiable homicide or not, as "assassinated" implies a premeditated action or "hit job" and "murder" is a legal term for a non-justifiable homicide. <a href="/wiki/User:Tornado_chaser" title="User:Tornado chaser">Tornado chaser</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Tornado_chaser" title="User talk:Tornado chaser">talk</a>) 13:19, 10 September 2017 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You'd need iron-clad sourcing for "assassinated" (which is murder + then some).

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Plimpton_322">Plimpton 322</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view/Noticeboard&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13" title="Edit section: Plimpton 322">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<p>In my view the article Plimpton 322 is not neutral. Editors refuse to mention a recent article in Historia Mathematica by Mansfield and Wilderberger which claims that the tablet is a trigonometrical table. This is an extremely prestigiuous journal on the History of Mathematics and the interpretation of the tablet which dominates the article, put forward by Eleanor Robson, first appeared in this journal. The only people interested in editing this article until recently were those who accepted Robson's interpretation and do not welcome this different interpretation, which is a revival of earlier interpretations. Since Mansfield and Wildberger's the article appeared in Historia Mathematica a month ago there has been a huge increase in traffic to the page and some people have expressed their surprise on the talk page that it is not mentioned and their view that it should be mentioned but they have not stuck around long enough to be involved in discussion. That may explain why I am in a minority of one. I think any neutral person would agree that Mansfield and Wildberger's article should be mentioned, but ensuring that it is is difficult. I do not fully agree with wikipedia's fringe policy but there is nothing fringe about this, it appears in a prestigious academic journal. It's a matter of concern that there is a backlog of editors to deal with this, it undermines the reputation of wikipedia. If you need more information please contact me on my talk page. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:9and50swans&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:9and50swans (page does not exist)">9and50swans</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:9and50swans" title="User talk:9and50swans">talk</a>) 21:27, 18 September 2017 (UTC)</p>

<li>For context, the article is <a href="/wiki/Plimpton_322" title="Plimpton 322">Plimpton 322</a>. This is the fourth place for Swans to <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:FORUMSHOP" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:FORUMSHOP">WP:FORUMSHOP</a> this dispute, after getting nowhere on the article talk page, an RFC on the article talk page, and <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:ANI" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:ANI">WP:ANI</a>. The core of the dispute is that Swans thinks we should add the reference merely because it was published in a "prestigious journal" and got some media hype, but without identifying any actual article content (either present now or to be added) that would be validly sourced by the reference. (Also note that one of the other contributors at the article talk is an author of the journal paper, and I suspect that an earlier IP contributor might be that same author. However, I have no reason to suspect any connection between these COI contributors and Swans.) —<a href="/wiki/User:David_Eppstein" title="User:David Eppstein">David Eppstein</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:David_Eppstein" title="User talk:David Eppstein">talk</a>) 21:43, 18 September 2017 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I got nowhere on the talk age for reasons mentioned above, but at least one established wiki editor Jimmaths, who can hardly be suspected of being a sock, agreed with me. Nobody responded to the RTC. fter being accused of bludgeoning by Eppstein I followed advice and sught to consult an adminsitrator, the only substantive response was that of EEng, whose 'humorous' approach seems quite out of place here. Eppstein has now conceded, (Plimpton 322 talk 22:10, 18 September 2017 (UTC)<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:9and50swans&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:9and50swans (page does not exist)">9and50swans</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:9and50swans" title="User talk:9and50swans">talk</a>) 04:18, 19 September 2017 (UTC)), that Historia Mathematica is the leading journal for the history of maths, I cannot think of a better criterion for mentioning Mansfield and Wildberger's artiocle than the fact that it appeared here. Clearly the editor and referees thought it had something worthwhile to say. I have a plane to catch and may not be able to contribute further until the end of the week. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:9and50swans&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:9and50swans (page does not exist)">9and50swans</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:9and50swans" title="User talk:9and50swans">talk</a>) 04:17, 19 September 2017 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your answer there consists of inferences drawn from the existence of the paper, none of which can be sourced to the paper itself (see <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:SYN" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:SYN">WP:SYN</a>).

Hitler clearly stated he was a "Positive Christian". Most scholars disagree, but a few argue that he certainly was indeed a Christian, albeit a very bad one.
